## 🎯 Immediate Priority Tasks

**Start with these "good first issue" tasks:**
1. **Set up testing framework with Vitest** - Foundation for quality
2. **Accessibility improvements** - Important for inclusivity

**Follow with these important enhancements:**
3. **Error handling improvements** - Better user experience
4. **Performance optimization** - Faster application
5. **Security audit** - Production readiness

## 📈 Success Metrics

Your kanban board is working well when:
- ✅ Tasks flow smoothly through columns
- ✅ "Ready" column has 3-5 well-defined tasks
- ✅ "In Progress" is limited to team capacity  
- ✅ "Review" column moves quickly
- ✅ Regular movement to "Done"

## 🔧 Daily Workflow

### For Team Members:
1. Check "Ready" column for available work
2. Move task to "In Progress" and assign yourself
3. Create feature branch: `feat/issue-number-description`
4. Work on task following acceptance criteria
5. Open PR with "Closes #issue-number"
6. Move to "Review" and request review
7. Merge when approved, move to "Done"

### For Project Lead:
1. Groom "Backlog" weekly - move ready items to "Ready"
2. Monitor "In Progress" for blockers
3. Review stale items in "Review" column
4. Archive "Done" items periodically
